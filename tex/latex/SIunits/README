The Systeme International d'Unites (SI), the modern form of the
metric system, is the most widely used system of units and measures
around the world. But despite this there is widespread misuse of the
system with incorrect names and symbols used as a matter a course -
even by well educated and trained people who should know better. For
example how often do we see: mHz, Mhz or mhz written when referring
to computer clock rates? The correct form is actually MHz. Note
the capitalisation does matter.

Hence, a clear system for the use of units is needed, satisfying the
next principles:
1) the system should consist of measuring units based on unvariable
  quantities in nature;
2) all units other than the base units should be derived from these
  base units; and
3) multiples and submultiples of the units should be decimal.

The name Systeme International d'Unites (International System of
Units) with the international abbreviation SI was adopted by the
Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) in 1960. It is a
coherent system based on seven base units (CGPM 1960 and 1971).

The SIunits package can be used to standardise the use of units in
your writings.  Most macros are easily adaptable to personal
preferences. However, you are welcome to suggest any improvements.
